## API Integration

The app is configured to connect to a backend API. In the development environment, it points to:

```
Base URL: http://localhost:3001
```

To point to a different API environment, update the `baseURL` in `Constants.swift`.

## Location Services

The app uses Core Location for:
- Tracking driver location
- Providing turn-by-turn directions to job sites
- Geotagging status updates and photos

Users will be prompted for location permissions during first use.

## Camera & Photo Library Integration

The app integrates with the device camera and photo library to:
- Take photos of deliveries
- Document job progress
- Upload evidence of completed jobs

Users will be prompted for camera and photo library permissions when these features are accessed.

## Persistence

The app uses:
- UserDefaults for general preferences
- Keychain for secure storage of authentication token
- Local caching for offline access to job data
